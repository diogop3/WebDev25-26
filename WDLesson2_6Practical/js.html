       <p>JavaScript is a versatile, high-level programming language primarily known for enabling interactive and dynamic content on websites. It works in conjunction with HTML and CSS to create rich user experiences, handling everything from form validation and animations to real-time updates and complex web applications. Beyond its client-side role in web browsers, JavaScript has expanded to server-side development with runtimes like Node.js, allowing developers to build full-stack applications using a single language. Its flexibility and extensive ecosystem of frameworks and libraries make it a fundamental technology for modern web development and beyond, extending to mobile apps, desktop applications, and even the Internet of Things.
